# My Code Diary

Starting from my frustration of feeling that my software development skills are stagnant and not progressing, I have decided to create this repository.
<br>
This is a personal roadmap, aimed at achieving a deeper understanding of software engineering. The learning path is based on my personal observations, with the assistance of <a href="https://www.roadmap.sh">roadmap.sh</a>, which clearly outlines the learning journey based on the experiences of various individuals in the software engineering community.
<br>
Within this repository, I will document all my progress in software engineering learning, as well as the projects I work on during the learning process.
<br>
I hope that this will be beneficial in improving my software development skills, both in the short, medium, and long term.

## Roadmap

Here is the roadmap I created based on my observations:
<img src="roadmap.png">
In the initial stage, I aim to learn the fundamentals of computer science and implement them in my projects as a full-stack developer.
<br>
Next, I want to dive deeper into web development, including frontend development, backend development, databases, and even DevOps.
<br>
Once I have a good understanding of how to create software projects effectively, I want to further explore how software should be designed, including design systems, architecture, and more.
